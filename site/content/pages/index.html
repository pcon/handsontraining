		<h1>Hands On Trainings</h1>
		<p>After doing a Hands On Training for Dreamforce I decided I wanted a way to make the content available for anyone who wanted it.  The problem was that handing someone a slide deck and workbook doesn't work. So I decided to make the training something that you can spin up a fresh Developer Edition org and walk through the concepts taught in the Hands On Training and the content as well</p>
